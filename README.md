# Signs_Detector_ResNet50
This project implements ResNet-50, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, for image classification. ResNet-50 is a variant of the Residual Network (ResNet) family, known for its use of skip connections (identity blocks) to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.

# ResNet-50 Image Classification

## üìå Overview
This project implements **ResNet-50**, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, using Keras with TensorFlow backend. The model includes identity and convolutional blocks with skip connections to mitigate vanishing gradients in deep networks.

## üöÄ Features
- **ResNet-50 Architecture**:  
  - Identity blocks (`identity_block`) and convolutional blocks (`convolutional_block`).  
  - Skip connections for stable training of deep networks.  
- **Customizable Input/Output**: Supports flexible input shapes and number of classes.  
- **Preprocessing**: Includes image normalization and one-hot label encoding.  
- **Training & Evaluation**: Tracks accuracy/loss during training and testing.  

## üõ† Installation
### Dependencies
Ensure you have the following installed:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow keras matplotlib scipy pydot ipythonDataset
The code assumes a dataset loaded via resnets_utils.py (not provided here). Replace with your dataset or ensure load_dataset() and convert_to_one_hot() are defined.

üè∑ Usage
1. Model Initialization
```bash
model = ResNet50(input_shape=(64, 64, 3), classes=6)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```
2. Data Preparation
```bash
# Example: Normalize and one-hot encode
X_train = X_train_orig / 255.0
Y_train = convert_to_one_hot(Y_train_orig, 6).T
```
3. Training
```bash
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```
4. Evaluation
```bash
preds = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {preds[1] * 100:.2f}%")
```
5. Model Summary
```bash
model.summary()  # Prints architecture details
```

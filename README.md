# Signs_Detector_ResNet50
This project implements ResNet-50, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, for image classification. ResNet-50 is a variant of the Residual Network (ResNet) family, known for its use of skip connections (identity blocks) to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.
